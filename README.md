This project analyzes baby name data from the Duke LearnToProgram course.

## Overview

- Uses Duke's `edu.duke` library and Apache Commons CSV to parse baby name CSV files.

- Example methods include analyzing girl name "Emily" and boy name "Drew" in 1990.

2. Make sure the `edu.duke` library is installed in your environment.
3. Place the CSV data file (e.g., `yob1990.csv`) in the project folder.
4. Run `BabyNamesAnalyzer` and call methods such as `countBirthsAboveEmily1990()`.
5. The program will prompt you to select the CSV file and then output the analysis in the console.

## Data Source
